        <p>Brampton, Ontario | bhavneetbola@gmail.com | (289) 889-1022</p>
        <p>I am a recent high school graduate heading to the University of Waterloo Biomedical
          Engineering program in fall 2022. Excited by opportunities to design, create, and
          become involved in my community!</p>
        <p><strong>July 2022:</strong> Current professional goals include refining my personal resume and finding a part-time
          job opportunity to add to my career profile. I will be adding to my list of personal projects
          by developing new soft and hard skills applicable in the engineering industry. Ultimately
          this will all hopefully be useful in making a portfolio for my co-op applications in the winter!
